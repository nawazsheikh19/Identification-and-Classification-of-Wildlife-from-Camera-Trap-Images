# Identification-and-Detection-of-Wildlife-from-Camera-Trap-Images-

1. Classified wildlife species using deep learning and computer vision from around 12000 images of 5 species captured
from camera-traps achieving an accuracy of 70%.
2. Applied MobileNet architecture for the classication of animals for the Missouri Camera Traps dataset which is novel
to the domain.
3. Used transfer learning to gain knowledge that can be utilized to attain new patterns for the same animal species on
any other dataset.
