This repository contains the code used for the following paper:

Identification and Classification of Wildlife from Camera-Trap Images using Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Authors: Nawaz Sheikh

If you use this code in an academic article, please cite the following paper:


This repository has four independent parts:

1- The code used for Task I: Detecting Images That Contain Animals (phase1 folder)

2- The code used for Task II,III, and IV: identifying, counting, and describing animals in images (phase 2 folder)

3- The code used for Task II only, (all the transfer learning experiments for Task II used this part of the repo) (phase2_recognition_only folder)

4- resize.py is used for resizing the input images for all the other parts
