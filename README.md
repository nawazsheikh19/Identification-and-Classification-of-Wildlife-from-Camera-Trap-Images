The link mentioned above contains the project report and the configuration manual. Both the report and configuration manual were written using Latex.


This repository has three independent parts:

1- The code used for Task I: Exploratory Data Analysis (phase 1 folder)

2- The code used for Task II,III, and IV: Applying InceptionV3, VGG and MobileNet algorithms to the dataset (phase 2 folder)

3- resize.py is used for resizing the input images for all the other parts.

The dataset can be found on the following link:
